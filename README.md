YoloTeeth represents a significant advancement in the realm of dental image analysis, leveraging the state-of-the-art **YOLOv8** architecture for instance segmentation and object detection of teeth in X-ray images. This repository sets a new benchmark in dental radiography, facilitating improved diagnostic capabilities and supporting rigorous research initiatives by accurately identifying and delineating individual teeth. The project aims to provide dental professionals with enhanced tools for diagnosing and understanding oral health through detailed image analysis.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- ![YOLOv8](https://img.shields.io/badge/yolov8-0.1.0-orange.svg) **YOLOv8**: The primary model utilized for real-time object detection and segmentation, featuring a single-pass architecture designed to optimize both performance and speed. YOLOv8 is known for its accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for complex tasks in medical imaging.
  


- ![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/pytorch-1.9.0-red.svg) **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework employed for model implementation and training. PyTorch's flexibility and ease of use allow for quick iterations and modifications, making it an excellent choice for developing machine learning models.


- ![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/opencv-4.5.1-brightgreen.svg) **OpenCV**: An essential image processing library utilized for managing and processing dental images. OpenCV provides numerous functionalities, such as image filtering, transformations, and augmentations, crucial for preparing data for model training.


- ![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/tensorflow-2.6.0-lightgrey.svg) **TensorFlow**: While primarily focused on YOLOv8, TensorFlow may be employed for additional model training or evaluation tasks, providing versatility in handling various machine learning tasks.



## üìä Dataset

The dataset employed in this project consists of **269 dental X-ray images**, along with their corresponding annotations, derived from my previous project: [Dental-X-RAY-Image-Detection-and-Instance-Segmentation](https://github.com/arpsn123/Dental-X-RAY-Image-Detection-and-Instance-Segmentation.git).

- **Training Set**: 
  - A comprehensive collection of 269 images, each converted into individual **YOLOv8 PyTorch TXT** files, resulting in 269 .txt files that provide the necessary data for training the model. This format ensures that the model can efficiently read and interpret the training data during the learning process.

- **Validation Set**: 
  - The validation dataset consists of 5 images, with their annotations also converted into YOLOv8 .txt files, resulting in 5 .txt files. This validation set is crucial for assessing the model's performance and ensuring that it generalizes well to unseen data.

## üìà Model Overview

**YOLOv8** distinguishes itself through its efficient architecture, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single inference pass. This model is designed to optimize the trade-off between speed and accuracy, incorporating advanced techniques such as a robust backbone network and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature extraction. The FPN enhances the model's ability to detect objects at various scales, making it particularly effective for analyzing dental images, where tooth sizes and positions can vary significantly.

## üìä Performance Evaluation

The evaluation of YOLOv8's performance is conducted through meticulous monitoring of loss and accuracy curves throughout the training process.

- **Loss Curve**: This curve tracks the model's ability to minimize the error between predicted bounding boxes and the ground truth annotations. Metrics such as mean squared error or binary cross-entropy loss are typically employed to gauge this performance. A decreasing loss indicates that the model is learning effectively, while plateaus or increases in loss may signal the need for further adjustments in training parameters.

- **Accuracy Curve**: Although accuracy is less commonly emphasized in object detection, metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and mean Average Precision (mAP) are crucial for assessing the model‚Äôs detection capabilities. Continuous monitoring of these metrics is essential for guiding model optimizations and training adjustments, ultimately enhancing object detection performance and addressing potential overfitting.

Monitoring these metrics allows for strategic adjustments to the training process, helping to ensure that the model can robustly identify and classify teeth in X-ray images, which is vital for effective dental diagnosis.

## üìÅ Integration of `data.yaml` in YOLOv8 Training

The `data.yaml` file is integral to the training process of YOLOv8, encapsulating critical metadata and configuration parameters associated with the dataset. This file facilitates the model's access to training and validation images and defines the number of classes and their respective labels, ensuring an efficient training configuration. The proper configuration of this file is essential for enabling the model to effectively learn from the dataset and achieve high accuracy in detection tasks.
